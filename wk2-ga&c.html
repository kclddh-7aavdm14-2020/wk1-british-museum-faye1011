            <h1>Google Arts & Culture</h1>


            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> Google Arts and Culture is an online archive displaying a variety of art works, it launched in February 2011 so it’s still a fairly recent platform. It’s solely an online platform that is available to the public to view high resolution images of art works and cultural artifacts from partner cultura platform was launched in 2011 so it’s quite recent. </p>

            <p> The platform has interactive experiences from <em>‘Climb Machu Picchu From Home’</em> to <em>‘How to Turn Yourself Into Van Gogh’</em> with a filter via an app to download. There is a huge variety of artwork and artifacts on the site to look through. You are able to search art through different categories such as; artists, mediums, art movements, historic events and also time and colour to name a few. You can also explore through popular topics and weekly highlights.</p>

            <h3> Vincent van Gogh</h3>

            <p>I visited the section on Van Gogh via the artists category, the page starts off with a short introduction of Van Gogh and there’s a link to an online exhibit which displays a slideshow of some ‘highlights’ of the artist’s work. This slideshow is a smooth interactive design that takes you through the paintings with descriptions by just scrolling down.
                Back to the artists page, it also displays 10 stories about Van Gogh which lead to interesting stories about the artist. For example; <em> '10 Things You Might Not Know About Vincent Van Gogh’</em>
                Below this there is <em>‘Discover this artist’</em> and displays many images of Van Gogh’s work that you can click on. Once you’ve clicked on an image it will bring you to a page with the image description, and also details which include but are not limited to; 
                <ul>
                   <li> title</li>

                    <li>medium</li>

                </ul>
                There is plenty of information about every piece of art and you are able to zoom into the high resolution image.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some exhibits also have a virtual tour experience which are 360 videos of the exhibit via YouTube. These experiences vary from exploring space in 360 degrees to viewing the world’s first large scale 3D printed sculpture.
                    This platform is made for anyone with an interest in art that would like to see and explore a variety of paintings and cultural objects. All in all, Google Arts and Culture is a good resource to find a large selection of art and cultural artifacts. There are <strong>lots of different</strong> pages to explore with different interactive activities and high resolution pictures  with a lot of information about each piece.
