        <h1> McCord Museum- Canada </h1>


<h3>Introduction </h3>

<p>The McCord Museum in Canada is a research and teaching museum, dedicated to the preservation, study, diffusion, and appreciation of Canadian history. Established in 1921 by David Ross McCord, based on his own family collections of objects. Since, the museums holdings have increased substantially. This museum is made for anyone wanting to explore Canadian history in more depth.

The website is dark themed and consists of lots of blocks, however on exploring the ‘search collections’ it takes you to a section of the website that looks a lot different. In my opinion it looks a lot less modern and doesn’t match the rest of the sites design. The museum has different collections to explore such as;

<ul>
    <li> Documentary Art</li>
    <li> Dress, Fashion and Textiles</li>
    <li> Indigenous Cultures</li>
    <li> Material Culture</li> 
    <li> Photography</li>
    <li> Archives</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Indigenous Cultures:</h3>

<p>I explored the Indigenous Cultures section, which has an introduction explaining that it consists of 16,000 archaeological artifacts recounting nearly 12,000 years of history. 

You have to view the objects individually as there isn’t an option to scroll through the different objects. I clicked on and viewed the Pipe, once on the a page, there is a picture of

the object and you are able to view it in ‘Full Screen’.  There’s information about the object to the left but no categories defining the information but you can find out the time-frame it came from, 

materials it’s made from, size of it, where it came from and so on. There is also a section below the picture were visitors are allowed to leave a comment of the item. Further down the page there is a section with a more detailed description of the Pipe under sections ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘when’ and ‘who’. </p>

<h3> Dress, Fashion and Textiles.</h3>

<p>This section comprises 20,000 garments and accessories made or worn in Canada over the past three centuries. It consists of all aspects of women’s, men’s and children’s fashionable clothing of the 19th and 20th century, including a range of different types of clothing. What I have noticed is that the items of clothing do not have specific names they are just named for sample ‘wedding dress’ or ‘evening dress’. It has the same categories of information as the Pipe did on the indigenous cultures section.

Overall, this museum holds interesting pieces from Canadian history however I think the website could have a smoother user experience for the online exhibits as well as a cleaner, more categorised design for the ‘Search Collections’ page.</p>
