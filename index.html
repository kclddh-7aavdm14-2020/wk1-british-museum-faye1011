<p>The British Museum, which was founded in 1753 and opened in 1759, was the first national museum to cover all fields of human knowledge that was open to visitors from all around the world.
It harbours information and materials from different cultures and their histories.</p>

<p>The British Museum has plenty of online collections available to view from: the Americas, Animals, China, Egypt and many more, each with a virtual tour using Google Street. 
The collection I explored in most depth was Africa, according to Wikipedia, the Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the biggest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world.
 A large amount of the material was donated by Sir Henry Wellcome in 1954. This archive displays collections of materials and visual culture relating to indigenous people across Africa. </p>

<p>Within the Africa collection, the categories of materials they hold are as followed; forged-metalwork, textiles, pottery-making, masquerade and sculpture. 
Clearly this archive is made for everyone wanting to explore the depths of African culture and arts, and will enlighten anyone with the history of different African cultures.
The collection consists of a variety of materials from Bronze-castings that come from Nigeria, to pottery all the way from Mali.</p>

<p>A particular object that stood out for me was the Man’s wrap-around garment made of silk. 
I was able to find out more information about this garment by clicking the ‘i’ icon which gave me more information. 
The garment is composed of 24 narrow strips joined at the selvedges by hand-sewn overcast stitch. 
It is a beautiful, colourful piece of silk material that was made in Ghana in the late 19th Century- early 20th Century. 
The piece was donated to the Museum by Antony Griffiths. Although there’s plenty of information and pictures, it’s hard to capture the real beauty of these objects through online alone. 
I can tell that all the objects in this gallery are magnificent and carry much meaning however I’m sure in person it would provide a much more emotional response / feeling. </p>

<p>Africa was a great collection to explore and I think majority of the collection was donated by individuals. 
Overall, I enjoyed my time exploring the British Museum and there website has enough information and pictures to give you a greater understanding of the collection you are viewing.</p>
